Greece relies heavily on tourism and feared a drop in visitor numbers because of its ongoing financial crisis, but it turns out there was no need to worry: [The country saw an 11 percent year-on-year rise between January to August 2015\.][0] This was most obvious to me in Santorini, where I spent a few days in September. It was shoulder season, although you would never have guessed this while battering through the hoards of travellers in Fira, the island's most popular area. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/35dcb28a-4e2b-4a8e-8938-0fc2a0df4031.jpg)
