            <title><![CDATA[Island hopping in Greece]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Island hopping in Greece</h1><p>Greece relies heavily on tourism and feared a drop in visitor numbers because of its ongoing financial crisis, but it turns out there was no need to worry: The country saw an 11 percent year-on-year rise between January to August 2015. This was most obvious to me in Santorini, where I spent a few days in September. It was shoulder season, although you would never have guessed this while battering through the hoards of travellers in Fira, the island's most popular area. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/82147708a2a4a6b8b5720d5d94737ca9f608bb96.jpg"></article>]]></description>
